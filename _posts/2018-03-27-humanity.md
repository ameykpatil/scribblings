*Both were strangers.*

*She was stuck, he was searching.*

*Her eyes full of agony & heart full of hope.*

*His heart full of agony & eyes full of hope.*

*When agony met hope,*

*Humanity killed strangers.*

This was written when it was raining cats & dogs in Chennai. There was an emergency situation in Chennai due to floods. But humanity was the highlight during this tough time. The tale was the tiny attempt to dedicate something for the spirit of the people & humanity!
