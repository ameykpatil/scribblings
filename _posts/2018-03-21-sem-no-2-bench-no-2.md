title: Sem No. 2 - Bench No. 2

**
*This post is a collection of the experiences from my initial semesters of engineering school. This is about 5 guys, with me being one of them. It revolves around the life & the fun we used to have back then. I had written this long back when I was in the final year of the engineering school. You may not understand or relate to each & every thing. But this will surely bring back some of your high-school memories. Glossary at the end of the post should help clear some of the terms.*

Once upon a time, they used to sit on the 2nd bench. It was the time when there used to be a strong racism among them and two extreme racist (black and white) used to win all the time. It was the time when the ***latecomer*** had only one reason — Palghar. The time when ***gymer*** used to click his own photos and the ***genius*** one used to work hard on it to make it real. When the ***thinner*** boy and the ***taller*** one used to compete in Drawing Practicals… in all the domains.

The time when there used to be a tough competition among Velankar, Jude, KS and the ***thinner*** boy. In the drawing class when their hands used to move in synchronisation just like celebrations after football goal and when the ***thinner*** boy used to make a football of the printouts given and KS used to blame the ***latecomer*** or the ***taller*** one. The time when they almost dragged the ***genius*** to their level and for that he must be very happy. The time when they used to share 2 note books among 5 people. One book of the ***genius*** and the other borrowed. It was the time when the maths teacher used to point out changes in d ***gymer***’s nature, and the others used to laugh hiding their faces in the books. The time when they used to eat tiffins during ‘sophisticated’ GD sessions. It was the time when they used to bunk the maths lecture through second door, and used to come back after watching all the carrom boards full. The time when they used to fight for a window seat, yes, window seat in a classroom.

The time when they used to play in gymkhana till 7.00 PM, when they used to finish any dish in less than 60 seconds, when they used to help each other in assignments and printouts and drawing sheets and auto-cad, when they used to sit on the “2nd bench”.

Roughly 3 months left, I think they can experience all those memories again, but…

*2nd Bench — 2nd row in a classroom. It’s an Indian style.*

*Palghar — A town far far away in Galaxy, from where reaching an engineering school on time was almost impossible.*

*Drawing Practicals—A session where you draw or sketch machines in an engineering way with the help of engineering gun & grenade, also known as drafter & roller.*

*Velankar, Jude, KS — Well known Professors for teaching Programming, also rivals of the **thinner** boy.*

*GD — Group Discussion, where a group of people interact with each other via irrelevant & incorrect information about a senseless topic.*

*Gymkhana — A place for indoor games, also the place having highest utilisation among all the places in an engineering school.*
